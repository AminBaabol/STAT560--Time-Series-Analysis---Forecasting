## Question 1:
(5 points) Plot the crime rate data vs the year.



## Discussion:
The plot indicates a steady rise in crime rate from 1984 up to around 1992, at 
which point there is a significant drop in crime rate.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
library(tseries)
library(zoo)
library(gridExtra)

Final_data <- data.frame(read_excel("~/Desktop/GradSchool/STATS 560 Time Series Analysis/Exams/Final_data.xlsx"))
head(Final_data)


#Converting it to time series
CrimeRate.ts = ts(Final_data[,2], start = 1984, end = 2005,frequency = 1)
CrimeRate.ts


#year vs. crime rate time series plot 
Original.ts <- plot(CrimeRate.ts, type = "o",
                   main = "Time Series Plot of The original Data")
Original.ts

```



## Question 2:
(10 points) Calculate and plot the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) and variogram.


##Discussion:
The ACF shows a sinusoidal pattern and significant higher lags.This indicates the
suspected nonstationary time series.Therefore, differencing this time series is 
recommended moving forward.

```{r}
set.seed(1242)
#Calcuation
ACF1.calculation <- acf(CrimeRate.ts, plot = FALSE)
PACF1.Calculation <- pacf(CrimeRate.ts, plot = FALSE)


#ACF plot
Original.ACF <- ggAcf(CrimeRate.ts,lag.max = 20)+labs(title = "ACF")
Original.PACF <- ggPacf(CrimeRate.ts,lag.max = 20)+labs(title = "PACF")
Original.ACF
Original.PACF

#Variogram
# Define the variogram function:from Dr. Fan's slides
variogram_func <- function(x, lag) {
  x <- as.matrix(x) 
  Lag <- NULL
  var_k <- NULL
  vario <- NULL
  for (k in 1:lag) {
    Lag[k] <- k
    var_k[k] <- sd(diff(x, k))^2
    vario[k] <- var_k[k] / var_k[1]
    }
  return(as.data.frame(cbind(Lag, vario)))
}


x <- CrimeRate.ts
lag_length <- 20
lag_CrimeRate <- 1:lag_length
z <- variogram_func(x, lag_length)
variogram_CrimeRate <- z$vario
variogram_CrimeRate

#Crime rate variogram plot
Orginal.variogram <- plot(lag_CrimeRate, variogram_CrimeRate,
                          type = "o",
                          col = "dark red",
                          main = "Variogram of Crime Rate")
Orginal.variogram


#frist 10 ACF and variogram values
paste("First 10 ACF Values")
ACF1.calculation[1:10]
paste("First 10 PACF Values")
PACF1.Calculation[1:10]
paste("First 10 variogram Values")
variogram_CrimeRate[1:10]

```



## Question 3:
#(5 points) Is there an indication of nonstationary behavior in the time series? 
Why or why not?



## Discussion:
The time series plot, ACF and variogram all agree that the crime rate is 
non-stationary time series.There is an apparent decreasing trend.The ACF plot in 
particular,shows an oscillating trend crossing the significant threshold 
at the first three lags as well as latter lags.While the variogram shows the increasing,decreasing trend. The Dicke-Fuller test also supports this interpretation 
having a p-value of 0.5932. This p-value is not statistically significant enough
to reject the null hypothesis that the time series is non-stationary.



```{r}
tsdisplay(CrimeRate.ts)

#Stationarity check :Dicke-Fuller test 
adf.test(CrimeRate.ts)
```



## Question 4:
(10 points) Calculate and plot the first difference of the time series. Show the 
first 10 differences.


```{r}
#calculating the first differencing
CrimeRate.Diff1 <- diff(ts(Final_data[,2],start = 1984, end = 2005,frequency = 1),
                        differences = 1)
CrimeRate.Diff1


# plot time series of the first difference
First.Diff <- plot(CrimeRate.Diff1, type = "o",
                   main = "Time Series Plot of The Differenced Data")
First.Diff


#First 10 differences
paste("First ten differences")
head(CrimeRate.Diff1,10)

```


## Question 5:
(10 points) Compute the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) and variogram of 
the first differences.


```{r}
#Stationarity check:ACF and PACF plots
ACF.diff1 <- acf(CrimeRate.Diff1, plot = FALSE)
PACF.diff1 <- pacf(CrimeRate.Diff1, plot = FALSE)
ACF.Diff1.Plot <- ggAcf(CrimeRate.Diff1,lag.max = 20)+labs(title = "ACF")
PACF.Diff1.Plot <- ggPacf(CrimeRate.Diff1,lag.max = 20)+labs(title = "PACF")

ACF.Diff1.Plot
PACF.Diff1.Plot

#Variogram of the first differences

x2 <- CrimeRate.Diff1
lag_length2 <- 19
lag_CrimeRate2 <- 1:lag_length2
z2 <- variogram_func(x2, lag_length2)
variogram_CrimeRate2 <- z2$vario
variogram_CrimeRate2

# First difference variogram plot
first.diff.variogram <- plot(lag_CrimeRate2, variogram_CrimeRate2,
                             type = "o",
                             col = "dark red",
                             main = "Variogram of first difference")
first.diff.variogram

#frist 10 ACF and variogram values fo the differences time seires
paste("First 10 ACF values of the differences time series")
ACF.diff1[1:10]
paste("First 10 PACF values of the differenced time series")
PACF.diff1[1:10]
paste("First 10 variogram Values of differenced time series")
variogram_CrimeRate2[1:10]


#Further stationarity checks
tsdisplay(CrimeRate.Diff1)

adf.test(CrimeRate.Diff1);
pp.test(CrimeRate.Diff1); 
kpss.test(CrimeRate.Diff1)
```




## Question 6:
(5 points) What impact has differencing had on the time series?



## Discussion:
The differencing was intending to remove the changing levels of the original time
time series data, so it detrended the time series.The ACF plot immediately lost 
the oscillation seen in the original time series.My only concern is that there is
still random fluctuations shown by the first differenced time series plot as well 
as the variogram plot.This indicates further diferrencing may be required moving
forward.




## Question 7:
Develop an appropriate exponential smoothing forecasting procedure for the first-
differencing data by answering the questions below.



### Part a:
(10 points) Assume the first-difference data is a constant process. For R user, 
use the HoltWinters() function to find the optimum value of 𝜆 to smooth the data.
For JMP user, specify the 𝜆 given by the software.



##Discussion
Holtwinter's method indicates a lambda value of 0.592 as the optimum lambda which
gives us a sum error squared of 12382.3.



```{r}

CrimeRate.fit <- HoltWinters(CrimeRate.Diff1, beta=FALSE, gamma=FALSE)

CrimeRate.fit$alpha


```


### Part b:
(10 points) Show the fitted values and corresponding SSE by using the 𝜆 obtained
in part a.


##Discussion
The fitted values are printed down and the sum squared error is 12382.3.

```{r}
set.seed(34378)
Holt.Model1 <- HoltWinters(CrimeRate.Diff1, beta=FALSE, gamma=FALSE)
Holt.Model1$fitted[,2]
sse <- sum((CrimeRate.Diff1-Holt.Model1$fitted[,2])^2)
sse
Holt.Model1$SSE


```


### Part c:
(5 points) Plot the fitted values and original values in a same plot.



## Discussion
This particular Holtwinter's method does not seem to be doing a great job of 
fitting. The fitted values seem to be close to the boundary of the confidence 
interval.It does alright in capturing the general patterns but not so well in 
fitting with good accuracy.This is because we are applying a data with a trend
on a model meant for a univariate data without a trend or season.


```{r}
#
plot(CrimeRate.Diff1, type = "l", 
     pch = 16, cex = 0.5,col = "blue",
     xlab = "Time",
     ylab = "Crime Rate Per 100,000",
     main = "Crime Rate Observed vs. Holt Winter's Fitted",
     panel.first=grid())
lines(Holt.Model1$fitted[,1],type = "l",
      cex = 0.5,
      col = "red")
legend(19,64, legend=c("Original", "Fitted"),
       col=c("blue", "red"), lty = 1:1, cex = 0.8)

```


### Part d:
(5 points) Assume the first-difference data shows a trend. Calculate the SSE. 
You can get it from the HoltWinters() function. Then compare the SSE with that 
of obtained in part b. What can you tell from the comparison?



## Discussion:
During the construction of this second HoltWinters model gamma was set to "FALSE"
because seasonality or cyclical fluctuations was not observed in the the first
difference time series. However, there was a trend which require Holt-Winters
exponential smoothing. So the default function optimized the best smoothing parameters as:
alpha: 0.7354783
beta : 0.44757
and sse of 21089.49 which is higher than the sse we obtained by treating the first
time difference data as a constant process.The sse we obtained from the first 
model was 12382.3. This fitted model seems to better predict or capture the 
trend in the time series than the previous model where the time series was assumed
to be a constant process. Although this model is still needs quite a bit more tuning 
before it's ready for deployment.



```{r}
Holt.Model2 <- HoltWinters(CrimeRate.Diff1,gamma = FALSE)
Holt.Model2
Holt.Model2$fitted
sse <- sum((CrimeRate.Diff1 - Holt.Model2$fitted[,1])^2)
sse
Holt.Model2$SSE

plot(CrimeRate.Diff1, type = "b", 
     pch = 16, cex = 0.5,col = "black",
     xlab = "Time",
     ylab = "Crime Rate Per 100,000",
     main = "Crime Rate Observed vs. Holt Winter's Fitted",
     panel.first=grid())
lines(Holt.Model1$fitted[,1],type = "l",
      cex = 0.5,
      col = "red")
lines(Holt.Model2$fitted[,1],type = "l",
      cex = 0.5,
      col = "green")
legend(2000,60, legend=c("Original", "Model1 Fitted","Model2 Fitted"),
       col=c("black", "red" , "green"), lty = 1:1, cex = 0.8)


```



### Part e:
(5 points) Suppose the first-difference is a constant process. Give the forecasts
of the crime rate for years from 2006 to 2010.


## Discussion:

The second model with the trend smoothing parameter seems to have larger prediction
interval and larger coefficients.


```{r}
Holt.Model1.Forecast <- predict(Holt.Model1, n.ahead = 5,
                                prediction.interval = TRUE)
Holt.Model2.Forecast <- predict(Holt.Model2, n.ahead = 5,
                                prediction.interval = TRUE)
Holt.Model1.Forecast
Holt.Model2.Forecast


```


## Question 8:

### Part a:
a. (10 points) Develop an appropriate ARIMA model and a procedure for forecasting 
for the crime rate data. Specify the model and estimated parameters in the model. 
Hint: You can use the auto.arima() and forecast() functions to answer this question



##Discussion:

The specified model is an arima(1,2,0) which can be written as arima(1,0,0) after 
2nd differencing.This follows logic because there was still a trend left in the 
first differenced time series. The 1 in the p parameter suggests that the autoregressive component is heavy handed in this model.The AR(1) coefficient is -0.4671  with
$mu$ of -1.6561.The AIC, AICc and BIC are respectively,AIC=190.48   AICc=191.98  
BIC=193.46.The ACF plot indicates there is no significant autocorrelation in the lags. 
The residuals are normally distributed with some skewness.The AR(1) model's coefficient
can be used for forecasting in the following manner:
$$y_{t} = 1.6561 - 0.4533*y_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}$$
$\phi = -0.4671 $
$$\hat{Y}(1) = \mu + \phi(Y_t-\mu)$$

(ψ0+ψ1B+ψ2B2+ψ3B3...)(1−φ\1B) = 1
(ψ0−ψ0φ1B+ψ1B−ψ1φ1B2+ψ2B2−ψ2φ1B3−+ψ3B3−ψ3φ1B4...) = 1
ψ0+B(ψ1−ψ0φ1) +B2(ψ2−ψ1φ1) +B3(ψ3−ψ2φ1) = 1


```{r}
set.seed(54842)
auto.arima(Final_data[,2])


#ARIMA1
arima.120 <- arima(CrimeRate.ts, order=c(1,2,0))
arima.120
fitted<-as.vector(fitted(arima.120))
fitted
#Model Adequacy
checkresiduals(arima.120)

#4-in-1 plot of the residuals
par(mfrow = c(2,2),oma = c(0,0,0,0))
qqnorm(arima.120$residuals,
       datax = TRUE,
       pch = 16,
       xlab = 'Residual',
       main = '')
qqline(arima.120$residuals,
       datax = TRUE)
plot(fitted(arima.120),
     arima.120$residuals,
     pch = 16,
     xlab = 'Fitted Value',
     ylab = 'Residual')
abline(h = 0)
hist(arima.120$residuals,
     col = "gray",
     xlab = 'Residual',
     main = '')
plot(arima.120$residuals,
     type = "l",
     xlab = 'Observation Order',
     ylab = 'Residual')
points(arima.120$residuals,
       pch = 16,
       cex = .5)
abline(h = 0)


#forecast
forecast(arima.120,5)
```


### Part b:
(5 points) Compare the AIC obtained from part a with that of obtained from ARIMA(0,1,0)
model. Which model has a smaller AIC? What can you tell by this comparison?



##Discussion:
The ARIMA(1,2,0) has a lower AIC of 188.6674, compared to ARIMA(0,1,0)'s AIC of 205.9326.
This makes sense because the arima(0,1,0) is a first order differencing. We know
from our earlier analysis that this time series data requires a second order
differencing. Hence, ARIMA(1,2,0) model is more adequate in properly characterizing 
the behavior of the time series data or the residual trend after taking the 
first differencing. 


```{r}
#part a AIC
AIC(arima.120)

#Arima(0,1,0) AIC
ARIMA.2 <- Arima((Final_data[,2]), order = c(0,1,0))
AIC(ARIMA.2)

```


### Part C:
(5 points) Show the 1- to 5- step ahead forecasts and corresponding 95% prediction 
intervals for the crime rate. Show only the results/outputs. Calculation process or 
formula are not required.



##Discussion:
We estimate the prediction error variance using the 
forecasting equation and plug it into the standard prediction interval equation.
$$ \hat{y}_{T+\tau}(T)\pm (1.96)*\sigma(\tau) $$
Regarding the forecasted values the lower bound of the prediction interval
seems to be getting smaller the farther ahead we predict into the future.
This is valid since error rate increases with with long-term forecasting.

```{r}

step.ahead.forecast <- as.data.frame(forecast(arima.120,5))
step.ahead.forecast


#Calculating 95% PI
paste("Lower bound 95% prediction inverval")
data.frame(step.ahead.forecast$`Lo 95`)


paste("Lower bound 95% prediction inverval")
data.frame(step.ahead.forecast$`Hi 95`)
